- 👋 Hi, I’m @hollyhenry
- 👀 I’m interested in all the math and science. I also am very into the outdoors with the family. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning electrical engineering while teaching my youngest to read, write and the basics of math.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything that seems like a fun rabbit hole to go down for the day.
